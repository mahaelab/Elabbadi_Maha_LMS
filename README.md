# LibraryApp Update

This project is a library management system (LMS) which allows users to add and remove books, or list the entire collections of books. All changes will be saved to the text file when finished.

New Changes:
- Load in, read, and save file from user input
- Remove a book using barcode or a title
- Books can be checked in or out
